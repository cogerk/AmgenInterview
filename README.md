## README

This is a repository for analyses done in preparation for an interview presentation with Amgen. All data is dummy data intended to imitate results from a real analysis done previously. Data is dummified in order to maintain NDA requirements. Analyses done here include:

- Design of Experiment (DoE) to specify data requirements (GenerateDoE.ipynb)
- Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear and Random Forest Regression Models (ComparingModels.ipynb)
- Interactive Techno-Economic Analysis (app.py)
  - This is deployed on Heroku and will be linked seperately.
